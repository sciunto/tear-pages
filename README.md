tear-pages
==========

Simple script to remove the first page of a PDF

Why?
====

Because many pdf providers such as scientific publishers like to add a useless cover page.
I don't want to:
* print the first page and sometimes I can forget to select the page range
* to scroll down to read the file

How to use?

It's dead simple
